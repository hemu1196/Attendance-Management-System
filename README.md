# Attendance-Management-System
An Attendance Management System for University, built for teachers, parents, and students. Teachers can mark attendance, parents can track their wardâ€™s records, and students can view their own Attendance. The system sends alerts when attendance falls below 75%, helping maintain attendance requirements.
